As an Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering at Colorado State University Pueblo, I lead cutting-edge research at the intersection of optimization, machine learning, and natural disaster resilience. My work, forged at the NIST-funded OU Community Resilience Research Lab during my Ph.D. at the University of Oklahoma, is all about creating tangible, real-world solutions for communities facing complex hazards.

My Expertise & Impact:
 * Resilient Infrastructure: I develop flood mitigation and evacuation models designed to minimize economic loss and enhance fairness, ensuring communities are better prepared for the unexpected.
 * Strategic Resource Allocation: My research leverages bi-level and stochastic optimization frameworks to improve resource deployment under deep uncertainty, a critical need during disaster response and recovery.
 * Applied Research: My findings are consistently published in leading academic venues, driving forward the understanding and application of resilience engineering.

With a Master's in Industrial and Systems Engineering and a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Analytics from OU, plus a Bachelor's from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, I bring a robust academic foundation. I'm passionate about mentoring the next generation of engineers, fostering interdisciplinary partnerships, and translating complex theories into actionable strategies in the classroom and beyond. I've taught a range of courses, including optimization, supply chain management, and resilience, at both OU and the Military Institute of Science and Technology.
